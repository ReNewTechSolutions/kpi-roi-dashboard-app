# KPI + ROI Dashboard — Investor-Style Pitch (Flippa / Buyer Deck Copy)

## The Opportunity
Most SMBs and agencies track KPIs in spreadsheets, and ROI tracking is usually inconsistent or not done at all. Teams want a simple, secure dashboard to track monthly performance and ROI outcomes without paying enterprise analytics pricing or building from scratch.

This project is a **production-ready SaaS starter** that solves the hardest foundational problem: **multi-tenant + secure data isolation** (RLS), with a clean UI shell and product-ready repo structure.

---

## What This Is
A deployable **KPI + ROI Dashboard SaaS starter** built on:
- **Next.js 16 (App Router)**
- **Supabase Auth + Postgres**
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** multi-tenant isolation
- **TypeScript** modular architecture
- **Vercel** deployment ready

It’s designed to be:
- deployed in ~30 minutes
- sold as a code asset (Flippa)
- or launched as a monetized SaaS / licensed internal tool

---

## Why Buyers Want This
### Buyers don’t want to build:
- authentication flows
- multi-tenant org/membership/roles
- secure tenant isolation (RLS)
- SSR-safe Next.js + Supabase patterns
- deploy-ready docs and structure

This repo provides the foundation so buyers can ship features and monetize quickly.

---

## Core Product Capabilities
- Multi-tenant org model (owner/member)
- KPI tracking (monthly entries: revenue/cost/notes)
- ROI model storage (JSONB inputs for scenarios)
- Protected routes + sign out
- Docs + schema + RLS included

---

## Competitive Advantage (Asset Value)
### 1) Security-first multi-tenancy
Tenant isolation is enforced at the database layer via Supabase RLS. This massively reduces the risk of cross-tenant data leakage.

### 2) Deployable + productized
Includes setup guide, schema scripts, and repo organization so buyers can deploy quickly.

### 3) Expandable monetization surface
Multiple obvious upgrade paths (Stripe plans, exports, charts, team invites) increase perceived value.

---

## Monetization Paths (What a Buyer Can Build Next)
### SaaS Subscriptions
- Free: 1 org, limited KPI months, limited ROI scenarios
- Pro: unlimited KPI months, ROI scenarios, export
- Team: multiple members, invites, roles, audit log

### Licensing
- Sell to agencies as a branded KPI portal per client
- Sell to SMBs as internal reporting software
- Sell to consultants as packaged KPI/ROI reporting

### Paid Add-ons
- exports (CSV/PDF)
- alerts (email/slack)
- forecasting
- multi-org switching + templates
- custom dashboards per role
